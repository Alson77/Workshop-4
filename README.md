Constructors
Constructors are special methods that run automatically when an object is created. They help by:
Initializing objects: They assign initial values so the object starts in a valid state.
Improving reliability: They prevent the object from being used before important values are set.
Improving maintainability: All setup logic stays in one place, making the code cleaner and easier to update.
3 Real-World Examples
Example 1: User account creation
A constructor sets the username, email, and encrypted password when the account is created.
Example 2: Game character creation
A character’s health, starting level, and abilities are assigned inside the constructor.
Example 3: Database connection
A constructor receives the connection string and establishes the database connection.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is an OOP principle that hides data inside a class and controls access using methods or properties. This protects the data from accidental changes and ensures it remains valid.
Classes and Objects
Class: A blueprint that defines attributes and behavior for objects.
Object: A working instance created from the class.
Two Simple Examples of Encapsulation
Example 1: Bank Account
You cannot directly change the balance amount. Only controlled methods like deposit and withdrawal are allowed.
Example 2: Student Marks
Marks cannot be changed to invalid values like −10 or 900. Encapsulation ensures only valid input is accepted.
